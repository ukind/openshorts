**Open source AI video platform** with 3 tools in one: **Clip Generator**, **AI Shorts (UGC videos with AI actors)**, and **YouTube Studio**.

![Your podcast, and the vertical clip OpenShorts makes of it: both speakers stacked, captions on the seam](screenshots/split-before-after.gif)

Two people on camera? OpenShorts stacks them instead of shrinking the wide shot, puts the captions on the seam where they cover nobody, and switches back to a face-tracked crop when the cut goes to one person. The AI picks the layout per video; nothing to configure.

**Two ways to run it, same software either way:**

|  | Self-hosted (this repo) | Hosted on [openshorts.app](https://www.openshorts.app/) |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Free forever, MIT | Free plan, paid from $12/mo |
| **Speed** | 5 to 8 min per 8-min video on CPU | About 50s on our NVIDIA GPU |
| **API keys** | Bring your own Gemini, ElevenLabs, fal.ai | Gemini included, nothing to set up |
| **Watermark / limits** | None, ever | Watermark and 20 min/mo on the free plan, neither on paid |
| **Setup** | Docker, 8GB+ RAM, model downloads | Sign in and paste a link |
| **MCP / API for agents** | Same `/mcp` endpoint, but only while your machine is on | Always-on endpoint at [mcp.openshorts.app](https://www.openshorts.app/mcp), API keys in one click |
| **Your data** | Your server | Ours |

Self-hosting is genuinely free and always will be. It costs you a machine, your own API keys and the time to keep it running. The hosted plans exist to cover that hardware and those keys, not to unlock features.

## How Much Does It Cost?

Self-hosting OpenShorts is free. You provide the machine and you only pay for the AI APIs you use, and most have generous free tiers:

| Service | Free Tier | Paid Cost | Used For |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Google Gemini** | Free trial with generous limits | < $0.01 per 10-min video | Viral moment detection, script generation, web research |
| **fal.ai** | Pay-per-use | ~$0.50-1.50 per AI Short | Actor generation, talking head video, lip-sync |
| **ElevenLabs** | Free tier available | Pay-per-use | Voiceover, voice dubbing |
| **Upload-Post** | **10 free uploads/month** to all networks (no credit card) | Pay-per-use | Auto-publishing to TikTok, Instagram, YouTube |
| **AWS S3** | Optional | ~$0.023/GB | Cloud backup for clips and gallery |

**Bottom line:** You can clip videos for practically free with Gemini, and publish 10 videos/month to all social networks at zero cost with Upload-Post.

**Don't want to run any of that?** [openshorts.app](https://www.openshorts.app/) is the same software on our hardware: our NVIDIA GPU clips an 8-minute video in about 50 seconds instead of the 5 to 8 minutes it takes on a typical CPU, the Gemini key is included, and auto-publishing is already wired up. Free plan is 20 minutes a month with a watermark and no credit card; paid plans start at $12/mo for 100 minutes without watermark.

## Requirements

- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Google Gemini API Key** ([Free — get it here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)) — required for all AI features
- **fal.ai API Key** ([Pay-per-use](https://fal.ai)) — required for AI Shorts (actor generation, video, lip-sync)
- **ElevenLabs API Key** ([Free tier](https://elevenlabs.io)) — required for voiceover/dubbing
- **Upload-Post API Key** ([free tier](https://upload-post.com)) — required for direct social posting

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mutonby/openshorts.git
cd OpenShorts
```

### 2. Configure (optional)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS keys for S3 backup
```

### 3. Launch
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Open Dashboard
Navigate to **`http://localhost:5175`**

1. Go to **Settings** and enter your API keys (Gemini, fal.ai, ElevenLabs, Upload-Post)
2. **Clip Generator**: Upload a long-form video to generate viral shorts
3. **AI Shorts**: Describe your product or paste a URL to generate UGC marketing videos
4. **YouTube Studio**: Generate thumbnails, titles, and descriptions for YouTube
5. **UGC Gallery**: Browse all generated videos and avatars

### 5. GPU acceleration (optional, NVIDIA)

The default image is CPU-only. With an NVIDIA card (any card with NVENC, e.g. RTX 4060) an 8-minute video clips in about a minute instead of 5 to 8. Nothing is passed through in the VM sense — the container just gets access to the host GPU.

**Host:** install the NVIDIA driver (`nvidia-smi` must work) and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html):
```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi   # sanity check
```
On Windows use Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend and the Windows NVIDIA driver; no driver inside WSL.

**Compose:** create `docker-compose.override.yml` next to `docker-compose.yml` (picked up automatically). `GPU: "1"` adds cuBLAS/cuDNN and onnxruntime-gpu to the image (~2 GB); `video` is required for NVENC.
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        GPU: "1"
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu, video]
```

**`.env`:**
```
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo
WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda
WHISPER_COMPUTE=float16
FFMPEG_ENCODER=auto           # probes h264_nvenc at startup, falls back to x264
TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=parakeet   # optional: ~2x faster than whisper, 25 European languages, auto-falls back to whisper
ASR_GPU_CONCURRENCY=1
```

**Verify:**
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker exec openshorts-backend nvidia-smi -L
docker exec openshorts-backend ffmpeg -hide_banner -f lavfi -i testsrc=size=256x256:rate=1 -frames:v 1 -c:v h264_nvenc -f null -
```
The backend log on the first job reports the chosen encoder and transcription device. A CUDA error in whisper (e.g. VRAM exhausted) retries once on CPU automatically. 8 GB of VRAM is enough for `large-v3-turbo` fp16 plus the detection models.

## Automate It: MCP Server, REST API and Webhooks

You don't need the dashboard. The whole pipeline is callable by AI agents and scripts.

### MCP server (`/mcp`)

OpenShorts ships a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, so Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor or any MCP client can clip and publish videos for you:

**claude.ai and ChatGPT**: paste `https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp` as a custom connector (Settings → Connectors) and approve the access on openshorts.app. The server does OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration, so there is no key to copy; the connection shows up under Account → API keys, where revoking it disconnects the app.

```bash
# Claude Code / Cursor / n8n (hosted): create an API key in your account page
claude mcp add --transport http openshorts https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer osk_..."

# Self-hosted (no key needed, BYOK rules apply):
claude mcp add --transport http openshorts http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

Tools: `process_video` (URL or `upload_id`; `captions: false` when the source already has subtitles, `auto_hook: false` to skip the hook line, burned by default like the dashboard), `create_upload` (hand the agent a local file: PUT the bytes, then process), `get_job_status`, `list_clips`, `get_quota`, `add_subtitles`, `recut_clip`, `publish_clip`. A prompt like *"clip this podcast and schedule the best 3 to TikTok"* is now a one-liner in your agent of choice.

### REST API + API keys

Hosted accounts can mint `osk_...` API keys (account page). A key authenticates as you everywhere — same plan, same minutes, same job ownership:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.openshorts.app/api/process \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer osk_..." -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...", "acknowledged": true,
       "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/hooks/openshorts"}'
```

Interactive docs at `/docs` (OpenAPI) on any instance.

### Completion webhooks

Pass `webhook_url` (and optionally `webhook_secret`) to `POST /api/process` and you get exactly one `POST` when the job reaches a terminal state — no polling loops in your n8n / Zapier / cron pipelines:

```json
{"event": "job.completed", "job_id": "…",
 "clips": [{"index": 0, "title": "…", "video_url": "…", "download_url": "…"}]}
```

With a secret, the body is signed: `X-OpenShorts-Signature: sha256=<hmac-sha256(body)>`.

### CLI

The same API from the terminal, zero dependencies (`cli/`):

```bash
pip install openshorts   # or: uvx openshorts

export OPENSHORTS_API_KEY=osk_...              # hosted
# export OPENSHORTS_API_URL=http://localhost:8000   # self-hosted, no key

openshorts process "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --wait
openshorts clips <job_id>
openshorts publish <job_id> 0 --platforms tiktok,youtube
```

### Agent skill

`skills/openshorts/SKILL.md` follows the open
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard, so it works in any
skill-capable agent:

```bash
# Claude Code (and most agents): copy the folder into the skills directory
cp -r skills/openshorts ~/.claude/skills/

# Hermes Agent: install straight from this repo
hermes skills install mutonby/openshorts/skills/openshorts

# OpenClaw: from ClawHub
openclaw skills install @mutonby/openshorts
```

### n8n

An importable workflow (video URL in, published-ready clips out, no polling)
lives in [`examples/n8n/`](examples/n8n/).

## Using an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (instead of, or alongside, Gemini)

OpenShorts uses Google Gemini by default for all AI work. Every TEXT stage can
instead run on ANY OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint — Ollama Cloud,
a local Ollama, MiniMax, OpenRouter, vLLM, llama.cpp server, an OpenAI-compatible
proxy — selected with three environment variables. Gemini stays the default:
with the variables unset, nothing changes.

### Configuration (server env)

| Variable | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | yes | Base URL of the OpenAI-compatible API, e.g. `https://ollama.com/v1` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | yes | API key (Ollama Cloud key, MiniMax key, OpenRouter key, ...). Any value works for a local Ollama (`ollama`). |
| `LLM_MODEL` | yes | Default model for all rerouted stages, e.g. `gpt-oss:120b` |
| `LLM_MODEL_THUMBNAIL` | no | Model for thumbnail title/concept text (defaults to `LLM_MODEL`) |
| `LLM_MODEL_SAAS` | no | Model for SaaS analyze/script text (defaults to `LLM_MODEL`) |

All three of `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL` are required: a
partially-set endpoint stays INERT (Gemini keeps running) with a one-line
warning naming what is missing. There is no `LLM_MODEL_EDITOR` yet — the
editor effects stage and the other Gemini-only stages below do not reroute.

### What reroutes, what stays on Gemini

| Stage | Reroutes to the endpoint? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Clip scoring + detail (the 2-pass analysis) | yes | including the blocked-content bisect ladder |
| Layout picker (12 frames) | yes | degrades to the default layout on any failure, exactly as with Gemini |
| Thumbnail titles / concepts / description (TEXT) | yes | image GENERATION stays on Gemini |
| SaaS analyze + script generation | yes | |
| SaaS web research (Google-Search grounding) | no — Gemini-only | skipped with a log line when only the endpoint is configured |
| Thumbnail image generation | no — Gemini-only | needs a Gemini key as before |
| Silent-video clip detection (vision) | no — Gemini-only | the endpoint cannot watch video |
| Editor effects (/api/edit, /api/effects) | no — Gemini-only | video upload stages |
| Cloud/managed mode | no — Gemini-pinned | `LLM_*` env vars are stripped from managed jobs |

Structured output: requests ask for `response_format=json_schema` first, fall
back to JSON mode, then to a plain request (every prompt embeds its JSON shape
in-band and responses are parsed tolerantly — the same ladder the Gemini path
uses). Provider policy refusals raise the SAME blocked-content error the Gemini
path raises (never retried; alerts classify it as "blocked content (user video)").
Provider outages (429/5xx/timeout) retry 3x with backoff on the CLIP PIPELINE
(main.py's _run_gemini_stage owns the retry loop); the thumbnail and SaaS text
endpoints call the endpoint once per request (no ladder) and surface the first
transient as their error. Bad keys and unknown models fail immediately with the
provider's message.

### Recipes

Ollama Cloud (hosted; get an API key at ollama.com):

```bash
LLM_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-...your-ollama-key...
LLM_MODEL=gpt-oss:120b
```

Local Ollama (same machine; any non-empty key value works):

```bash
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=ollama
LLM_MODEL=qwen3:32b
```

MiniMax M3 (OpenAI-compatible endpoint):

```bash
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.minimax.io/v1
LLM_API_KEY=eyJ...your-minimax-key...
LLM_MODEL=MiniMax-M3
```

OpenRouter (one key, many models):

```bash
LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

vLLM, llama.cpp and anything else speaking `/v1/chat/completions` works the
same way. Vision stages (layout picking, thumbnail title brainstorm) need a
model that accepts base64 images; they are sent as data URLs.

### Per-request BYOK (API / MCP callers)

Self-host callers can override the endpoint per request with headers (base-url
AND key must be sent together — a header key is never sent to an env-configured
base URL):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/thumbnail/analyze \
  -H "X-LLM-Base-Url: https://ollama.com/v1" \
  -H "X-LLM-Key: $OLLAMA_KEY" \
  -H "X-LLM-Model: gpt-oss:120b" \
  -F "file=@video.mp4"
```

Caveat: like `X-Gemini-Key`, header-provided config does NOT survive a
redeploy-resume — an interrupted job falls back to the server's env (and, with
no env config, fails with the normal missing-key message). Env-configured
endpoints survive restarts and resumes.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Warning "...no model is set... backend stays inactive" | `LLM_MODEL` (or the per-task var) is missing; Gemini keeps running |
| `LLM provider rejected the request (HTTP 401)` | Wrong API key |
| `HTTP 404` naming the model | Model does not exist on that endpoint (`ollama pull` it, or fix the name) |
| `LLM provider response was truncated (finish_reason=length)` | Model context too small for transcript + frames — pick a larger-context model |
| `LLM provider timeout` / `transient error (HTTP 429/5xx)` | Retried 3x automatically; if it still ends the job, the endpoint was down — try again later |
| `The AI provider blocked this video's content (...)` | The endpoint's policies refuse this material — same meaning as Gemini's blocked error, never retried |
| Jobs use Gemini despite LLM_* being set | The three required vars are not all set (check the startup warning), or you are on cloud/managed mode (pinned to Gemini) |

Rollback: unset the `LLM_*` variables and restart — the pipeline returns to
Gemini with no code or data changes.

MIT License for the core application — OpenShorts is yours to use, modify, and scale.

**Exception:** the [`cloud/`](cloud/LICENSE) directory (billing, managed keys, and the hosted-service infrastructure behind the optional `BILLING_ENABLED` flag) is source-available under the OpenShorts Commercial License. You can read it, modify it, and self-host it for personal or internal use, but you can't offer it to third parties as a paid/hosted service. Self-hosting the core app never requires this directory.
