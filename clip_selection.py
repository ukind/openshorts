    Measured on prod 3-ago-2026: 408 of 429 jobs (95%) delivered 3 clips or

    shortlisted window. Users who received 1-3 clips came back a second day
    0.4% of the time; those who received 4-9 came back 16.1% — so the clip
    count, not the clip quality, is what the retention curve hangs on.

    The old prompt biased hard the other way ("prefer one great clip per
    candidate window") and handed the model two unbounded licences to drop
    clips (the 2-second rule and STANDS ALONE both end in "or skip it"), with
    no floor to stop it collapsing to a single clip. This puts a floor and a
    realistic ceiling on it instead.

    The detail pass hands its clips back in transcript order, batch after

    minute three: the model proposed clips across the whole video, and the
    ones covering the demo, the MCP walkthrough and the close were the tail
    that got dropped. Worse, the failure scales the wrong way — the more
    generous the model is, the more of the video disappears.

    That sabotages the windowing: get_viral_clips builds scoring windows
    precisely because "a single call over the whole transcript clusters picks
    near the start", and a positional slice puts the clustering right back.

    Ranking is by ``predicted_score`` (the detail prompt already asks for it,
    and nothing else was reading it here). Ties keep transcript order, and the
    survivors come back in transcript order too, so clip numbering still runs
    front to back the way every caller downstream expects.
