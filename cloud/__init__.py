"""Optional cloud (paid / managed-keys) mode for OpenShorts.

This whole package is dormant unless the ``BILLING_ENABLED`` env flag is set.
``app.py`` imports it only in that case, so self-hosters never need the extra
dependencies in ``requirements-billing.txt``.

Wiring is split in two because Starlette forbids adding middleware after the app
has started:
  - ``setup_sync(app)``   -> runs at import time (middleware + routers)
  - ``setup_async(app)``  -> runs in the lifespan (DB engine, sweeper, orphans)

Both are built up phase by phase; each phase appends its own wiring.
