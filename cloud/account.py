"""Account erasure: the GDPR Art. 17 "right to be forgotten", self-service.

The privacy policy already promises that "deleting your account from the
dashboard removes your content on the schedule above" — this is the code that
makes that sentence true. It is one endpoint, ``DELETE /api/account``, and it
is immediate and irreversible: erasure has to happen "without undue delay", and
once the account is gone there is no way left to authenticate whoever asks for
it back, so a recovery window would be a window nobody could safely use.

Two rules shape the order of operations below, and both come from asking what
happens when a step fails halfway:

1. **Stripe first, and abort if it refuses.** Deleting the user row while a
   live subscription keeps charging a card we can no longer map to anyone turns
   a privacy fix into a billing incident nobody can unwind. Cancelling first
   means the worst case is a cancelled subscription on an account that still
   exists — annoying, retryable, harmless.
2. **R2 before the database.** Those DB rows are the only index of which
   objects belong to this user. Drop them first and a failed R2 delete leaves
   objects that nothing in the system can ever find again; the bucket already
   carries orphans from an earlier version of this reasoning.

What deliberately survives: the Stripe customer and its invoices (six-year
retention under Spanish commercial law, privacy policy §5) and one
[AccountDeletion] row proving the erasure happened — a sha256 of the email
rather than the address, and no free text anywhere in it. The confirmation
email tells the user both, because a record they were never told about is not
accountability, it is retention.
