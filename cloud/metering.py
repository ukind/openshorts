"""Minute metering: quota reservation, commit and release — atomic and restart-safe.

Accounting model (all serialized by a per-user ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` lock):

* A subscription grants ``minutes_per_period`` for the window
  ``[current_period_start, current_period_end)``. Usage against the plan is the
  sum of ledger rows tagged with the current ``period_end`` and status
  reserved|committed. Rows from previous periods carry a different ``period_end``
  and stop counting automatically → renewal needs no cron.
* Top-ups form a FIFO pool (``minutes_total - minutes_consumed``) that persists
  across periods and survives cancellation.
* A reservation consumes IMMEDIATELY (not at commit): plan first, then top-ups
  FIFO. Because the whole split happens while holding the user lock, concurrent
  reservations can never oversell. ``commit`` just flips the row to committed;
  ``release`` refunds the exact top-up allocation recorded on the row.

Probing input duration (ffprobe / yt-dlp metadata) lives here too.
