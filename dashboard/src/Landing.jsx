      question: "Is OpenShorts really free? What's the catch?",
      answer: "There is no catch, but there are two different things on offer. (1) Self-hosted is 100% free and open source: you run it with Docker on your own machine, bring your own API keys, and there are no watermarks, no usage limits and no subscription. What it costs you is hardware and time. On a typical CPU an 8-minute video takes 5 to 8 minutes to process, and you need your own Google Gemini key (required, free tier is 1,500 requests/day), plus ElevenLabs for dubbing and fal.ai for AI Shorts if you want those. (2) Hosted at openshorts.app is the same software with the running costs covered: our NVIDIA GPU clips that same 8-minute video in about 50 seconds, the Gemini key is included so there is nothing to create or paste, auto-posting to TikTok, Instagram and YouTube is already wired up, and your clips are stored and re-openable from any browser. It has a free plan (20 minutes a month, watermark, no credit card) and paid plans from $12/mo for 100 minutes without watermark. So: free if you are happy to run it yourself, paid if you would rather it just ran fast. Both are far cheaper than Opus Clip ($15-228/month) or Kapwing ($24-79/month)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is OpenShorts and how does it work?",
      answer: "OpenShorts is a free, open source AI clip generator that transforms your long-form videos — podcasts, webinars, livestreams, vlogs, interviews — into viral-ready short clips in 9:16 vertical format. It uses a multi-step AI pipeline: faster-whisper for transcription with word-level timestamps, PySceneDetect for scene boundary detection, and Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite AI for identifying the most engaging viral moments. According to HubSpot's 2025 State of Marketing report, short-form video delivers the highest ROI of any content format, and repurposing long-form content into shorts increases total reach by up to 300%."
    },
    {
      question: "How does OpenShorts compare to Opus Clip?",
      answer: "OpenShorts is a free, self-hosted alternative to Opus Clip. Both offer AI viral moment detection and smart vertical cropping. Key differences: OpenShorts is completely free vs Opus Clip's $15-228/month pricing. OpenShorts runs on your infrastructure (full data privacy) vs cloud-only. OpenShorts uses Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite for AI analysis vs Opus Clip's proprietary model. OpenShorts adds AI voice dubbing in 30+ languages, AI-generated video effects, and hook text overlays. The trade-off is that OpenShorts requires Docker self-hosting, while Opus Clip is a ready-to-use cloud service."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I turn a long-form video into TikTok or Reels clips?",
      answer: "Upload your long-form video into OpenShorts, enter your free Gemini API key, and click Process. The AI transcribes it with faster-whisper, detects the best viral moments using Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite, and crops them to 9:16 vertical format with MediaPipe face tracking. According to Wyzowl's 2025 Video Marketing Statistics report, 91% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, and repurposed short-form clips drive 2.5x more engagement than original content."
    },
    {
      question: "Can OpenShorts generate YouTube thumbnails and titles for free?",
      answer: "Yes. OpenShorts includes a free AI YouTube thumbnail generator, a free AI YouTube title generator, and a free AI YouTube description generator — all powered by Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite. Upload your video and the AI suggests 10 viral title options with an interactive refinement chat. Then it generates multiple thumbnail designs using AI image generation — upload a face photo and background image for personalized results. The studio also auto-generates YouTube descriptions with chapter timestamps and lets you publish directly to YouTube. Everything is 100% free with the Gemini free tier."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the AI UGC Video Generator?",
      answer: "OpenShorts includes an AI UGC (User Generated Content) video creator that generates marketing videos with AI actors for any product or business. You describe your product or paste a website URL — the AI writes a viral script, generates a realistic AI actor with lip-synced voiceover, adds b-roll visuals, TikTok-style subtitles, and hook text overlays. The result is a ready-to-post vertical video for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts. Two cost modes: Low Cost (~$0.65/video using Hailuo + VEED Lipsync) and Premium (~$2/video using Kling Avatar v2)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the AI UGC Video Generator for any type of business?",
      answer: "Yes. The AI Shorts generator works for any product, service, or business — not just SaaS. You can use it for restaurants, e-commerce stores, coaching services, local businesses, personal brands, apps, and more. Just describe your business in the text field (e.g. 'Artisan pizza restaurant in Madrid, wood-fired oven, home delivery') or paste your website URL, and the AI generates viral marketing scripts tailored to your business."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to generate an AI UGC video?",
      answer: "OpenShorts itself is free, but the AI Shorts feature uses external APIs (fal.ai for video generation, ElevenLabs for voiceover) that charge per use. Low Cost mode costs approximately $0.65 per video (Flux image $0.05 + ElevenLabs voice $0.10 + Hailuo img2video $0.19 + VEED Lipsync $0.20 + b-roll $0.10). Premium mode costs approximately $2.00 per video using Kling Avatar v2 for higher quality. Both modes are significantly cheaper than hiring UGC creators ($50-500 per video) or using platforms like HeyGen ($24-180/month)."
    },
    {
      question: "What AI does OpenShorts use for viral moment detection?",
      answer: "OpenShorts uses Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite, Google's latest multimodal AI model, for viral moment detection and title generation. The AI receives the full video transcript with timestamps, scene boundary data from PySceneDetect, and analyzes engagement patterns to identify the 3-15 most shareable moments. Each clip is scored based on emotional impact, hook strength, and viral potential — similar to how platforms like TikTok and YouTube rank content."
    },
    {
      question: "Can OpenShorts translate and dub videos into other languages?",
      answer: "Yes. OpenShorts integrates with ElevenLabs AI dubbing to translate your video audio into over 30 languages while preserving the original speaker's voice characteristics. After dubbing, the system automatically re-transcribes the new audio and generates subtitles in the target language. This makes it easy to repurpose content for global audiences — studies show that dubbed content receives 2-3x more engagement in non-English markets."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the smart vertical cropping work?",
      answer: "OpenShorts offers two intelligent cropping modes for converting 16:9 horizontal video to 9:16 vertical format. TRACK mode uses MediaPipe face detection with YOLOv8 as fallback to follow a single subject with 'Heavy Tripod' stabilization — the camera moves smoothly like a professional cameraman. GENERAL mode handles group shots and landscapes by creating a blurred background layout. A SpeakerTracker prevents rapid switching between subjects and handles temporary occlusions for smooth results."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free open source clip generator?",
      answer: "Yes — OpenShorts is a 100% free, open source clip generator (also known as open source clipping software or an AI video clipper). Unlike paid clip generators like Opus Clip ($15-228/month) or Kapwing ($24-79/month), OpenShorts lets you generate unlimited clips with no watermarks, no usage limits, and no subscription fees. It also includes a free AI YouTube thumbnail generator, free AI YouTube title generator, and free AI YouTube description generator — features that other clip generators charge extra for. You self-host it with Docker on your own machine for full privacy and control."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I automate OpenShorts from Claude, ChatGPT or n8n?",
      answer: "Yes. OpenShorts has a native MCP server at mcp.openshorts.app/mcp plus a REST API with per-user keys and completion webhooks, so an AI agent can run the whole flow: submit a video URL, wait for processing, list the clips and publish them to TikTok, Instagram or YouTube. This is where the hosted service shines: an agent needs an endpoint that is always on, and the hosted one is, with the API key created in your account page in one click. The self-hosted edition serves the same /mcp endpoint, but only while your own machine is running. There is also a zero-dependency CLI (pip install openshorts) and an importable n8n workflow. Full guide at openshorts.app/mcp."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the system requirements to run OpenShorts?",
      answer: "OpenShorts runs on any system with Docker installed. The recommended setup is 8GB+ RAM and a modern multi-core CPU. GPU acceleration (NVIDIA CUDA) is optional but speeds up video processing significantly. The Docker Compose setup handles all dependencies automatically — Python 3.11, FFmpeg, YOLOv8, MediaPipe, faster-whisper, and the React dashboard. It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL2/Docker Desktop)."
