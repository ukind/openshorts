const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Is OpenShorts really free? What's the catch?",
    answer: "There is no catch, but there are two different things on offer. (1) Self-hosted is 100% free and open source: you run it with Docker on your own machine, bring your own API keys, and there are no watermarks, no usage limits and no subscription. What it costs you is hardware and time. On a typical CPU an 8-minute video takes 5 to 8 minutes to process, and you need your own Google Gemini key (required, free tier is 1,500 requests/day), plus ElevenLabs for dubbing and fal.ai for AI Shorts if you want those. (2) Hosted at openshorts.app is the same software with the running costs covered: our NVIDIA GPU clips that same 8-minute video in about 50 seconds, the Gemini key is included so there is nothing to create or paste, auto-posting to TikTok, Instagram and YouTube is already wired up, and your clips are stored and re-openable from any browser. It has a free plan (20 minutes a month, watermark, no credit card) and paid plans from $12/mo for 100 minutes without watermark. So: free if you are happy to run it yourself, paid if you would rather it just ran fast. Both are far cheaper than Opus Clip ($15-228/month) or Kapwing ($24-79/month)."
  },
  {
    question: "How does OpenShorts compare to Opus Clip?",
    answer: "OpenShorts is a free, self-hosted alternative to Opus Clip. Both offer AI viral moment detection and smart vertical cropping. Key differences: OpenShorts is completely free vs Opus Clip's $15-228/month pricing. OpenShorts runs on your infrastructure (full data privacy) vs cloud-only. OpenShorts uses Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite for AI analysis vs Opus Clip's proprietary model. OpenShorts adds AI voice dubbing in 30+ languages, AI-generated video effects, and hook text overlays. The trade-off is that OpenShorts requires Docker self-hosting, while Opus Clip is a ready-to-use cloud service."
  },
  {
    question: "Can OpenShorts generate YouTube thumbnails and titles for free?",
    answer: "Yes. OpenShorts includes a free AI YouTube thumbnail generator, a free AI YouTube title generator, and a free AI YouTube description generator — all powered by Google Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite. Upload your video and the AI suggests 10 viral title options with an interactive refinement chat. Then it generates multiple thumbnail designs using AI image generation — upload a face photo and background image for personalized results. The studio also auto-generates YouTube descriptions with chapter timestamps and lets you publish directly to YouTube. Everything is 100% free with the Gemini free tier."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free open source clip generator?",
    answer: "Yes — OpenShorts is a 100% free, open source clip generator. Unlike paid clip generators like Opus Clip ($15-228/month) or Kapwing ($24-79/month), OpenShorts lets you generate unlimited clips with no watermarks, no usage limits, and no subscription fees. It also includes a free AI YouTube thumbnail generator, free AI YouTube title generator, and free AI YouTube description generator — features that other clip generators charge extra for. You self-host it with Docker on your own machine for full privacy and control."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to generate an AI UGC video?",
    answer: "OpenShorts itself is free, but the AI Shorts feature uses external APIs (fal.ai for video generation, ElevenLabs for voiceover) that charge per use. Low Cost mode costs approximately $0.65 per video (Flux image $0.05 + ElevenLabs voice $0.10 + Hailuo img2video $0.19 + VEED Lipsync $0.20 + b-roll $0.10). Premium mode costs approximately $2.00 per video using Kling Avatar v2 for higher quality. Both modes are significantly cheaper than hiring UGC creators ($50-500 per video) or using platforms like HeyGen ($24-180/month)."
  },
  {
    question: "Does API and MCP access cost extra?",
    answer: "No. Every plan, including the free one, can create API keys in the account page and use the REST API and the MCP server at mcp.openshorts.app/mcp. Calls draw from the same monthly minutes as the dashboard, so automating with Claude, ChatGPT or n8n does not change the price of anything. The value of the hosted endpoint is that it is always on: an agent or a scheduled pipeline can clip and publish while your own machine is off, which is the one thing the self-hosted edition cannot do for you. Full guide at openshorts.app/mcp."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the system requirements to run OpenShorts?",
    answer: "OpenShorts runs on any system with Docker installed. The recommended setup is 8GB+ RAM and a modern multi-core CPU. GPU acceleration (NVIDIA CUDA) is optional but speeds up video processing significantly. The Docker Compose setup handles all dependencies automatically — Python 3.11, FFmpeg, YOLOv8, MediaPipe, faster-whisper, and the React dashboard. It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL2/Docker Desktop)."
