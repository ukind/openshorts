"""Reframe engine v2: analyze in Python, render natively in ffmpeg.

v1 decodes every frame at full resolution in OpenCV, crops/resizes in numpy
and pipes raw frames back into ffmpeg. v2 splits that into:

  1. ANALYSIS — one ffmpeg-decoded pass at <=640px feeding the same detectors
     and the same SmoothedCameraman/SpeakerTracker state machines as v1, so
     the resulting camera trajectory (crop x per frame) is equivalent.
  2. RENDER — one ffmpeg process per scene doing decode -> dynamic crop
     (sendcmd) -> scale -> encode natively (TRACK scenes), or the blurred
     background filtergraph (GENERAL scenes); segments are then concatenated
     with stream copy and the audio mapped straight from the source clip.

No raw-frame piping, no second full-res decode, one less intermediate encode.
Callers must treat any exception as "fall back to the v1 loop".

Pure helpers (sendcmd/concat generation, scene slicing) have no heavy imports
so they stay unit-testable in CI.
