"""SCREENCAST layout: full-width content on top, the speaker underneath.

The fourth layout. It targets the failure this repo has now attacked three
times: a screen recording that happens to contain a face gets classified TRACK,
the 9:16 crop keeps a centre strip, and the chart or headline the shot is
actually about comes out sliced mid-word.

The two previous attempts tried to find that content in pixels and both failed
(see the note above analyze_scenes_strategy in main.py): edge density and MSER
text density BOTH score ordinary detailed footage higher than a clean panel of
text, because they measure visual busyness rather than meaning. The third
attempt asked Gemini and detected well, but decided badly: it flagged corner
tickers and demoted well-framed talking heads to the blurred layout.

What is different here is the question asked and what the answer is used for.

  - The question is how much of the WIDTH the content spans, not how much of the
    duration it covers. Coverage did not separate the cases (screencasts ran
    88-97% of the video, a corner-ticker clip 2%, but the failure was on the
    ticker anyway). Width is the quantity that actually decides whether a 9:16
    crop destroys information: a corner bug spans ~15% of the frame and survives
    any crop, a spreadsheet spans ~100% and cannot.
  - The answer routes to THIS layout, not to GENERAL. The old wiring's worst
    case was shrinking a subject into blurred filler to preserve a corner
    counter. Here the worst case is showing the content full width above the
    speaker, which is a reasonable frame even when the trigger was wrong.

Off by default (``SCREENCAST_LAYOUT=1``). Needs a Gemini key, or this job's
``OPENAI_*`` endpoint when its model passes the vision probe; with neither it
is a silent no-op, like every other optional path here.
