"""Access control on the one endpoint that serves the untouched original.

/api/source streams the file we downloaded, not a derived clip, so an open
version of it is a public downloader wearing a UUID. A <video src> cannot send
an Authorization header, so the owner mints a signed URL from /api/source-url
and hands the player that.

BILLING_ENABLED=0 here (conftest), which is the self-host branch: no owner to
check and no secret to sign with, so the open path must keep working exactly as
before. That regression is most of what these tests are for.
